The year of the commute. Began the year with a short term contract at Rocket Base in Worthing, spending more time on the bus and train than I did working. Later I started part-time at Intermedia which was based in Braishfield; a 35 mile round trip when I didn't own a car, many thanks to my parents. Also discovered Wainwright which gave me something to aim for when in the Lake District.
