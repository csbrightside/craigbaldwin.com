Personal website of front-end developer Craig Baldwin working at We Make Websites.

This site has been built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify-templates/victor-hugo) template. It has been developed using HTML, SCSS, vanilla JS, and markdown. It does not support Internet Explorer 11.

The repo is continuously deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Code quality standards follow [We Make Websites'](https://github.com/we-make-websites/wmw-coding-guidelines) (which I wrote).

See _package.json_ for full list of dependencies.
