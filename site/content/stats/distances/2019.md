The year started so well, running further and faster than I had in years. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to me, I'd picked up a stress fracture in my left shin in December 2018. I continued running until a swelling finally got painful enough to warrant finding out what was going on in July and that's when I stopped running and reduced my walking. And that's how I spent the rest of my year, waiting, frustrated.
