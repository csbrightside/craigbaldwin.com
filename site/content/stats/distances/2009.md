Last year of University when I started tracking my distances using Google Earth and Maps to calculate everything (no Fitbit back then). Coincidentally the 1.2 mile per day average was the distance from where I lived to the University campus. Many days I didn't even leave the house. I only started tracking from part way through the year.
