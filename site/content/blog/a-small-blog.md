I've decided to write a blog again. I'm sure it will be infrequent at best but I've occasionally had thoughts I'd quite like to express so I'm going to do it here.

## What will I blog about?

I'm a developer at We Make Websites so mostly about that, I come across interesting solutions from time to time which you might find interesting. Also We Make Websites is perhaps one of the largest Shopify-only agencies out there and there's some noteworthy things when working with Shopify at scale I'd like to share.

That's all for now.
