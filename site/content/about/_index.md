{{<

  title="Hello"
  copy="I'm Craig Baldwin, We Make Websites' Development Lead, living in London. Front-end developer, Shopify expert, avid runner and walker."
>}}

I've worked at [We Make Websites](https://wemakewebsites.com/) for three years, specialising in the front-end development of Shopify e-commerce stores. I'm the Development Lead and help lead a team of 20-plus developers alongside the DevOps Lead. I've led the development of, and launched, six stores and supported the ongoing development of many more.

I enjoy technically challenging briefs which require a degree of complex problem solving and have a tendency for perfectism in my code. My background in Graphic Design gives me an eye for design and I'm at my best when I have agency over the solution.

## Skills
Regularly code in HTML, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, Vue.js, and Shopify Liquid. Experienced using Bitbucket, DeployBot, Git, Figma, GraphQL, Contentful, and data layers. The company workflow follows the agile methodology and includes the use of Asana, GSuite, Notion, Slack, and VS Code with a tech stack including webpack, yarn, npm, and Cypress automated testing.

## Responsibilities

As Development Lead I'm responsible for company development standards, tools, and documentation with a shared responsibility for code quality, excellence of technical solutions, and helping to drive best-in-class development.

As a senior front-end developer I also provide code review feedback and developmental guidance which ensures continued code quality. I work with project managers to create briefs, solve technical hurdles, provide quotes, maintain client documentation, and write technical specifications.

## Experience
Studied Graphic Design and Photography at the [Winchester School of Art](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/wsa/index.page), graduated in 2010 with a 2:1. In 2017 started working at We Make Websites as a front-end developer. Previously worked for [Intermedia](https://intermediasolutions.com/) for six years; a print and digital marketing agency.

## Personal
In my spare time I enjoy [running, swimming](https://www.strava.com/athletes/craigbaldwin), and [walking](/stats/mountains). I like to keep track of all my [stats](/stats/distances). I'm most at home on the fells of the Lake District which I try to visit as often as possible. I hope to one day have climbed all 214 fells described by Alfred Wainwright. I also enjoy photography, bouldering, and kayaking.
